# Slicing-a-list-for-an-adventure-game
You are writing an adventure game and you are required to implement some of its
functionality. For this question, you’ll need to read a tutorial on the Python random library
such as this one: https://pythonspot.com/random-numbers/
1. Your adventurer has a backpack containing the following items:
a. Water flask
b. Cheese
c. Gold coins
d. Handkerchief
e. Tinderbox
f. Scrolls
g. Dagger
h. Rope
i. Nuts
j. Pipe
k. Tobacco
l. Wine skin
m. Herbs
n. Axe
2. Create a new Python file and populate a list called rucksack with these items as
strings.
3. Now, sort your rucksack using the sort() function and print out a list of the items
in it.
4. Now print how many items you have in your rucksack.
5. Your adventurer finds a treasure chest which contains gems and a necklace. Add the
chest items to your rucksack and sort it again, printing its contents again.
6. Your adventurer goes to sleep and a thief steals 5 random items from your rucksack.
Remove 5 random items and list your rucksack’s contents again.
